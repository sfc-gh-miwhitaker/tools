    "- Confirm both accounts are in the same organization.\n",
    "- Have ORGADMIN enable replication for the accounts (Snowflake docs: enable replication for accounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue: \"Database cannot be replicated\" / \"Database missing from group\"\n",
    "- Confirm the database is not created from a share.\n",
    "- Confirm the role creating the group has `MONITOR` on the database.\n",
    "- Confirm the database does not contain unsupported objects for replication (see Snowflake limitations).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue: \"Timeout during a refresh\"\n",
    "- Increase statement timeout for the session running the refresh:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER SESSION SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 604800;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue: \"Scheduled refresh not running\"\n",
    "- In the SOURCE account, confirm `REPLICATION_SCHEDULE` is set on the primary group.\n",
    "- In the TARGET account, confirm scheduled refresh is not suspended (`SHOW REPLICATION GROUPS LIKE '<name>'`).\n",
    "- Ensure the group owner role has the privileges required for refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue: \"High replication costs\"\n",
    "- Increase the refresh interval.\n",
    "- Reduce the number/size of databases in the group.\n",
    "- Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY` (or Account Usage views) to quantify credits/bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue: \"Refresh fails\"\n",
    "- Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS` and `..._HISTORY` to get phase-level details.\n",
    "- Check for dangling references with `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REPLICATION_GROUP_DANGLING_REFERENCES`.\n",
    "- If needed, run a manual refresh (`ALTER REPLICATION GROUP <name> REFRESH`)."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Naming\n",
    "- Name replication groups clearly (for example, `PROD_REDUNDANCY_RG`).\n",
    "- Use the same replication group name in source and target accounts.\n",
    "- Document the primary group identifier (`<org>.<account>.<group>`).\n",

    "- Avoid over-frequent refreshes if you do not need them (cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Monitoring\n",
    "- Use:\n",
    "  - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS` (current/most recent)\n",
    "  - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY` (last 14 days)\n",
    "  - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY` (credits/bytes, last 14 days)\n",
    "- Add alerts for failed refreshes (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Security and access control\n",
    "- Use least privilege:\n",
    "  - `CREATE REPLICATION GROUP` on the account (or ACCOUNTADMIN)\n",
    "  - `MONITOR` on each database you include\n",
    "  - `REPLICATE` on the group for roles that need to refresh a secondary group\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Performance and reliability\n",
    "- Increase statement timeout for large refreshes when needed.\n",
    "- Keep the group focused (only replicate what you actually need).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Documentation\n",
    "- Maintain a list of replicated databases and target accounts.\n",
    "- Document the intended RPO and monitoring approach.\n",
